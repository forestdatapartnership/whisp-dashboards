# Whisp Dashboards



The Whisp dashboard allows you to display statistics on deforestation risk in your plots in a **clear and interactive manner**.


Through the [Whisp App](https://whisp.openforis.org/submit-geometry), risk analysis of your plots based on open source spatial data has been made easy and convenient. Upload your geometries as GeoJSONs in EPSG 4326 projection in the Whisp app and make sure to tick the box "Generate GeoIds". The output statistics from the Whisp App are delivered in the well-established and interoperable CSV format that can be used for further analysis in a multitude of programs, including ***MS PowerBI***, ***Tableau*** or other software of choice.


Here you can find dashboard templates that can be adapted and updated with your individual risk analysis outputs from Whisp App.  These dashboards provide users with a clear overview of deforestation risk indicators according to different data sources in their plot. 

The default ***MS PowerBI*** dashboard, including all widgets, filters and power queries to prepare the data to be visualized. You can test the template with the sample global data:
